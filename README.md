# PATH TEXT #
   Pick one of our selected Possession Paths to begin your Minimalistic Haiku Journey.
        It helps to Name it by what exactly you are focusing on.

Next you will see the broken down Stages we have mapped out to help you to rid yourself of the excess baggage

SHOULD BE ON A TIP CARD?? >> We developed this system also for those in a rush, short on time.. SO, if that is you:

Don't worry, just pick a drawer! a shelf, your desk -
We have tried and tested this, there is no need to overwhelm yourself, 
        the benefit of breaking these tasks into small chunks is paramount.
        It still gets the job DONE and you can be VERY proud that you are doing it
        all the while being a busy bee in your daily life or juggling a kid.













# STAGE DRAFTS #

>> Stage 1 : Title 

Description
Kick the Process into action by taking a PICTURE of what you want to minimalise, Haiku it down to its best, increase functionality to.

Tip

>> Stage 2 : Title 

Description
Here empty the area, take it ALL OUT, yes even if its scary, VACATE THE AREA, show us the space you are working with so you have better chances to work out what it needs.

Tip
LOOK AT THE MESS - know that it is a sign that you are dealing with things rather than hiding them, it is a sign the journey has begun, even if you have to leave it at this stage and run to work, know that with just 30 mins here and there, you will soon have this bit tackled!!! and boy will it feel good!!!

>> Stage 3  : Title 

Description
HAIKU it down, look at each thing closely, will this serve you in the future?

Tip
Are you having flashbacks with certain items or small random bits? Is it something Sentimental? Put it aside and deal with it last. When you are ready, go back to it, and check if its something you can get rid of by adding to your Thing Shui.

>> Stage 4  : Title 

Description
Now its time to put your beloved things back, try to organise them in ways that help you use them, see them better, do not underestimate the power of putting things in boxes.

Tip
If you haven't enough time or money to buy different sized boxes, gather Shoe boxes, cut off the lids of some if need be, the base of an egg box can hold many small items like rubbers or screws inside the drawer. Folding things in vertical rolls like a clothing filing cabinet can make access quicker, and if within boxes - those can be even stacked within drawers!

>> Stage 5 : Title 

Description
You have done it, to complete the process, take a picture of your end result!!! <3

      IN THE PROCESS OF ACHIEVING A MORE MINIMAL LIFESTYLE.... Some of us,
      namely at least half of the creators of this App, attach sentimental value
      to EVERYTHING. There is little need for the physical item to remain hidden
      in a box or cluttering a shelf somewhere forgotten.</p>
