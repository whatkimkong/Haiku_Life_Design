# PATH TEXT #
   Pick one of our selected Possession Paths to begin your Minimalistic Haiku Journey.
        It helps to Name it by what exactly you are focusing on.

Next you will see the broken down Stages we have mapped out to help you to rid yourself of the excess baggage

SHOULD BE ON A TIP CARD?? >> We developed this system also for those in a rush, short on time.. SO, if that is you:

Don't worry, just pick a drawer! a shelf, your desk -
We have tried and tested this, there is no need to overwhelm yourself, 
        the benefit of breaking these tasks into small chunks is paramount.
        It still gets the job DONE and you can be VERY proud that you are doing it
        all the while being a busy bee in your daily life or juggling a kid.
